# Botnet Dataset Generator

Steps to execute the code are as follows:
1. Install dotenv, pandas & dask libraries.
2. Rename '.env.example' to '.env', then adjust the variables
3. Execute main.py, and follow the menu.
4. Check the generated dataset at /result folder

--I really need input and suggestions so that this code becomes more user friendly--
Thank You
