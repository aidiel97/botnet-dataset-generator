# botnetDatasetGenerator
in supporting botnet paralel detection, the dataset is required. This is the research to generate the dataset

Steps:
1. first create a folder with the following conditions:
  /src
  /result
  /extract
    -/ctu
      -/1
      -/2
      -...
      -/13
    -/ncc
      -/1
      -/2
      -...
      -/13
 2. Then you can execute main.py, and follow the menu
 3. Finally, you can check the result of generation at /result folder
 
 --I really need input and suggestions so that this code becomes more userfriendly--

Thank You
