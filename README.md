# botnetDatasetGenerator
in supporting botnet paralel detection, the dataset is required. This is the research to generate the dataset

Steps:
1. first create a folder with the following conditions:\n
  /src\n
  /result\n
  /extract\n
    -/ctu\n
      -/1\n
      -/2\n
      -...\n
      -/13\n
    -/ncc\n
      -/1\n
      -/2\n
      -...\n
      -/13\n
 2. adjust the location of your dataset on /src/dataloader.py (datasetLocation)
 3. Then you can execute main.py, and follow the menu
 4. Finally, you can check the result of generation at /result folder
 
 --I really need input and suggestions so that this code becomes more userfriendly--

Thank You
